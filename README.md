# GUI

This is our awesome GUI that we're going to write hopefully in Kivy.
Lol we suck at GUI.

# API

## Install

```bash
cd api;
virtualenv -p `which python3` venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run # default port 5000, you can change it with: [-p 1337]
```
